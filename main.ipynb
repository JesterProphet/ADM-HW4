Then we retrieve all movies that have **exaclty** the same `lsh_band`. At last we group by the `user_id` and define two new aggregated values: The total `movie_count` of each user and based on the intersection in `lsh_bands` the `similarity` score which is the division of `lsh_bands_count` and the size of `user_lsh_bands`. We are using the `movie_count` as a tie breaker if the `similarity` score is the same. At the end we only return the first two entries."
